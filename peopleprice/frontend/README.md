# PeoplePrice

PeoplePrice is a web application for uploading, sharing and viewing prices of everyday items in different locations. Think of it as a community market place where people can upload prices in real time to help others who are living nearby find the best price.

This project is built with React and Vite but it's currently under development. New features will be subsequently added overtime.

## Features

- Add prices for items by location
- Filter and search for items and locations
- View a list of submitted prices

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   
## Notes

- Contributions and feedback are welcome as development continues.
