# ABOUT 
PeoplePrice is an app that will help users find the best price
for all the basic things they use daily. The app is going to be made opensource,
with the aim of controlling price and making the lives of people easy.
    This project is also to systematically prevent manufacturers umreasonably increasing prices of
products while simultaneously reducing the quality of the products. Basically to curtail unfair
practices against the consumers of Nigeria first, then the world.
