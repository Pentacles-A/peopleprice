# ABOUT 
PeoplePrice is an app that will help users find the best price
for all the basic things they use daily. Not only that, it provides data on where to get the best prices for the same product and location of shops/stores where it is available for purchase. The app is going to be made opensource, so that people can access it for free.
The central aim is to control prices of products and make the lives of people easy, especially during
these trying times.
    This project is also to systematically prevent manufacturers umreasonably increasing prices of
products while simultaneously reducing the quality of the products. Basically to curtail unfair
practices against the consumers of Nigeria first, then the world.
